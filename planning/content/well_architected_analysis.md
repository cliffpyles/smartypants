# AWS Well-Architected Framework Analysis

## Operational Excellence

- Serverless architecture to reduce operational burden
- Need to establish strong lifecycle approach with pre-production environments, CI/CD, and automated deployments
- Implementing logging and monitoring for quick issue diagnosis (CloudWatch, X-Ray)
- Use ORR and game days to simulate events and identify potential issues

## Security

- Cognito for secure user access management
- @auth directive for fine-grained access control in GraphQL schema
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Regular audits for maintaining security posture
- Regular credential rotation and use of AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive information
- Use AWS WAF for protection against common web exploits

## Reliability

- Use of highly available and durable services like DynamoDB, Lambda, AppSync
- Need to employ strategies like idempotent mutations in GraphQL for robust error handling
- Monitoring of system health and alerts for unusual behavior
- Use of auto-scaling for handling varying loads
- Regular failover testing for quick recovery from failures
- Backup and restore strategies

## Performance Efficiency

- Lambda for on-demand compute resource usage
- DynamoDB for fast and predictable performance
- Regular review and monitoring of service limits to handle increased demand
- Regular performance metrics review for identifying bottlenecks and improvements
- Leverage caching (like Amplify's caching) to improve performance and reduce backend load

## Cost Optimization

- Serverless architecture to pay only for what you use
- Regular cost monitoring
- Need to explore optimization, such as right capacity or reserved instances for DynamoDB, Lambda memory optimization etc.
- Use cost allocation tags to track AWS resource costs
- Set custom cost and usage budgets with AWS Budgets for alert on cost or usage exceed
