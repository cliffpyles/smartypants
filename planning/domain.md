# Domain: Command Line Application for AI Services

## Domain Models

1. **Application**: The main command-line interface tool, SmartyPants. This is the overarching context within which the other domain models operate.

2. **Plugin**: A unit of functionality within the SmartyPants application. It provides a specific set of commands to interact with various services or perform different operations. For example, OpenAI, Core, and Plugins can be seen as different Plugin models within the SmartyPants application.

3. **Command**: A specific operation that can be performed by SmartyPants or its plugins. Each command has its own set of arguments and options. Examples of commands include "create", "delete", "export", "fork", "draw", and "send".

4. **Argument**: Arguments are parameters that provide necessary data for commands. For instance, the "chat_name" argument provides the name for a chat when using the "create" command in the chat functionality.

5. **Option**: These are optional parameters that alter the behavior of a command. Options are not necessary for the command to run, but provide enhanced or specific functionality when included.

6. **Message**: In the context of the chat functionality in the OpenAI plugin, a Message represents a single unit of communication sent to OpenAI.
